I made a new JUCE audio plugin and I've been following this tutorial for building a multiband compressor from the ground up, which is what I've been trying to do the entire semester: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo0Oco3Vimo. I plan on finishing it this weekend. Once I do, I will either add more stuff to my compressor, or create another plugin for either wavetable synthesis or EQ.
