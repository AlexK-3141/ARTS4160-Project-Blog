Stuff I did:
- I got more familiar with my coding environment, I should've read more of the JUCE documentation instead of going down a rabbit hole of Google searches every time I got the slightest bit confused when setting up everything last week
- My plugin didn't have MIDI input and output pins, so I fixed it by cleaning the solution container in Visual Studio, which gets rid of intermediate and output files: https://forum.juce.com/t/midi-in-out-pins-not-appearing-in-audiopluginhost/31181
- I tried to watch "Juce Tutorial 14- Creating Your First Plugin (Pt 1)" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JUvVnRZrjg) but it was a bit too advanced so I watched "Juce Tutorial 10- Generating Audio Output" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjNeYI6-uNE) and followed along to make a white noise generator, which is not in the repo at the moment

Stuff I'll do next:
- I'll watch more videos from this JUCE tutorial playlist to become more familiar with JUCE: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLgJJsrdwhPxa6-02-CeHW8ocwSwl2jnu
