The bare minimun of things I'd like my OTT replica to do/have:
- Split frequency spectrum of audio input into multiple different bands (at least three preferred)
- Compress each band independently
    - Both upwards and downwards compression
- Components:
    - In gain knob
    - Out gain knob
    - Wet/dry knob
    - Upwards compression knob
    - Downwards compression knob
