My goals are to learn how to produce and compose house, trap, dubstep, drum and bass, and hardstyle songs. By producing, I mean sampling and creating my own sounds, such as drums, basses, and synths. By composing, I mean taking these sounds and using them to create coherent songs. In other words, I want to make producing and composing songs that are danceable and fun to listen to a hobby. In this class, I want to create 1-3 plugins that are functionally the same or similar to other plugins that are popular among electronic music producers. If I have the time, I would then like to compose a short song aligned with one of the following genres mentioned above.
