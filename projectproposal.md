My goals are to delve into composing EDM and turning it into a hobby. To get started with doing this, I want to produce an EDM song as my project for this class. I will find a free alternative to Serum and use it, along with other plugins I find interesting, to delve into sound design. I will also learn the basics of production and composition. Once I have the sufficient skills, I wish to try making a coherent house, dubstep, or hardstyle song.
