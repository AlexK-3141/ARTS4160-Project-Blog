    - "Multiband upwards/downwards compressor" plugin based on the OTT compressor preset in Ableton
        - Multiband compression: splits the frequency spectrum into different bands (ranges from a lower to a higher frequency), each band can be compressed independently
            - OTT splits frequency spectrum into 3 bands
        - Upwards compression: increases the volume of anything under the threshold
        - Downwards compression: decreases the volume of anything above the threshold
    - Components:
        - Depth knob - adjusts dryness/wetness - amount of processing applied to the signal
        - Time knob - adjusts the attack and release of the signal simultaneously
        - In Gain knob - gain of signal before processing
        - Out Gain knob - gain of signal after processing
        - Upwards Compression knob
        - Downwards Compression knob
