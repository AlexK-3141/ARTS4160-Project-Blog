Stuff I did:
- Moved OneSound folder from repository
- Bought more data for GitHub Large File System so I can push updates to this repository to the internet
- Watched tutorials 00-02 from the JUCE Framework Tutorials playlist (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLgJJsrdwhPxa6-02-CeHW8ocwSwl2jnu)

Stuff I'll do next:
- Watch tutorials 03-15, to learn how to code the front end of JUCE applications and get JUCE plugins to work with a DAW
