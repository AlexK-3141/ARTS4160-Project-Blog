Xfer OTT info:
 - "Multiband upwards/downwards compressor" plugin based on the OTT compressor preset in Ableton
    - Multiband compression: splits the frequency spectrum into different bands (ranges from a lower to a higher frequency), each band can be compressed independently
        - OTT splits frequency spectrum into 3 bands
    - Upwards compression: increases the volume of anything under the threshold
    - Downwards compression: decreases the volume of anything above the threshold
- Components:
    - Depth knob - adjusts dryness/wetness - amount of processing applied to the signal
    - Time knob - adjusts the attack and release of the signal simultaneously
    - In Gain knob - gain of signal before processing
    - Out Gain knob - gain of signal after processing
    - Upwards Compression knob - adjusts the amount the volume of anything under the threshold increases
    - Downwards Compression knob - adjusts the amount the volume of anything above the threshold decreases
    - A knob for the gain of each band (high, medium, and low)
    - 3 bars (sliders) allowing you to change the threshold of each band

Other notes:
- Compressor vs. filter: compressors reduce dynamic range, which is the difference between the loudest and quietest parts of a sound (measured in decibels), while filters manipulate sounds by boosting and/or attenuating (making softer) certain frequency ranges
- Threshold - the level at which compression begins (measured in decibels)
